# go-junit-report

go-junit-report is a tool that converts [`go test`] output to a JUnit compatible
XML report, suitable for use with applications such as [Jenkins].

## Install from package (recommended)

Pre-built packages for Windows, macOS and Linux are found on the [Releases]
page.

## Install from source

Download and install the latest stable version from source by running:

```bash
go install github.com/joschi/go-junit-report/v2@latest
```

## Usage

By default, go-junit-report reads `go test -v` output generated by the standard
library [testing] package from `stdin` and writes a JUnit XML report to
`stdout`.

Go build and runtime errors are also supported, but this requires that `stderr`
is redirected to go-junit-report as well.

Typical use looks like this:

```bash
go test -v 2>&1 ./... | go-junit-report -set-exit-code > report.xml
```

### More examples

JSON produced by `go test -json` is supported by the `gojson` parser. Note that
`stderr` still needs to be redirected to go-junit-report in order for build
errors to be detected. For example:

```bash
go test -json 2>&1 | go-junit-report -parser gojson > report.xml
```

Full example, where Go test result is parsed as JSON, the test execution
output is printed as part of go-junit-report and the step fails in case
of test failure.
```bash
go test -json ./... 2>&1 | go-junit-report -set-exit-code -parser gojson -iocopy -out report.xml
```

Go benchmark output is also supported. The following example runs benchmarks for
the package in the current directory and uses the `-out` flag to write the
output to a file called `report.xml`.

```bash
go test -v -bench . -count 5 2>&1 | go-junit-report -out report.xml
```

The `-iocopy` flag copies `stdin` directly to `stdout`, which is helpful if you
want to see what was sent to go-junit-report. The following example reads test
input from a file called `tests.txt`, copies the input to `stdout` and writes
the output to a file called `report.xml`.

```bash
go-junit-report -in tests.txt -iocopy -out report.xml
```

### Flags

Run `go-junit-report -help` for a list of all supported flags.

| `-in file`            | read go test log from `file`                                                    |
| `-iocopy`             | copy input to stdout; can only be used in conjunction with -out                 |
| `-no-xml-header`      | do not print xml header                                                         |
| `-out file`           | write XML report to `file`                                                      |
| `-package-name name`  | specify a default package name to use if output does not contain a package name |
| `-parser parser`      | specify the parser to use, available parsers are: `gotest` (default), `gojson`  |
| `-p key=value`        | add property to generated report; properties should be specified as `key=value` |
| `-set-exit-code`      | set exit code to 1 if tests failed                                              |
| `-subtest-mode`       | set subtest `mode`, modes are: `ignore-parent-results`, `exclude-parents`       |
| `-version`            | print version and exit                                                          |

## Go packages

The test output parser and JUnit XML report generator are also available as Go
packages. This can be helpful if you want to use the `go test` output parser or
create your own custom JUnit reports for example. See the package documentation
on pkg.go.dev for more information:

- [github.com/joschi/go-junit-report/v2/junit]
